Computer-Name
=============
This is a simple Cocoa/Objective-C application which lets the user rename the "Computer Name", as well as the "Local Host Name". 
The application requires the name to be less than 15 characters, and must consist of alphanumeric characters or a dash "-", in order to accommodate Active Director standards.

Do whatever you like with the codebase, though attribution would be nice.

Thanks,
